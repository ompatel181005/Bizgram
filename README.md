# Bizgram

// Okay Listen up Public!
// All the files you see rn are related to the website we are making and I got them from making a react project using typescript.
// to run the website and see what it is currently here are the steps:

1. make sure to go in terminal and do cd Bizgram
2. make sure you are in the right directory by typing ls if you see a bunch of confusing files ur in the correct directory if you see 2 files then your are not go to step 1
3. run npm run dev to launch the website it will give you a link the the terminal

// IMPORTANT :
we do not need to touch any file that is not un src sub folder. I have made userlist, sidebar part of the home page.

IGNORE every other file especially the json files dont tweak them.

thats pretty much it.

make sure to

git add .
git commit -m "your message"
before you pull (even when u want to push)

after pulling adjust changes made (if in the same file), do not get rid of someones code just make sure to have it in the final merge. then and then only push or else we may lose previous version.

make sure to

git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push

to push your changes
